- For 3 particle try changing the angle of one and plot
- Maybe change some of the potential visualisations to have different potential functions

- try fitting for 2 particles

- explain degeneracy for 3 particles
- explain cutoff for 3 particles

- look at differences of ds/df

- write up something about the calculation of the cutoff angle 

- explore different potentials

- dlvo possible
